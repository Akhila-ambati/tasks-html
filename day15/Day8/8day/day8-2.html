        <p>Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information<br> and no elements of chance. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in <br>an 8×8 grid. The players, referred to as "White" and "Black", each control sixteen pieces: one king, <br>one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black.<br> The game is won by checkmating the opponent's king, i.e. threatening it with inescapable capture.<br> There are several ways a game can end in a draw.</p>
